    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        These roasted Brussels sprouts taste sweet and salty at the same time. 
        <br>They're seasoned perfectly and very easy to make. The sprouts should be 
        <br>brown with deliciously crispy bits on the outside when done 
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pounds Brussels sprouts, ends trimmed and yellow leaves removed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all your ingredients. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).</li>
        <li>
            Place trimmed Brussels sprouts, olive oil, kosher salt, and pepper in a large 
            <br>resealable plastic bag. Seal tightly, and shake to coat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour onto a baking sheet, and place on center oven rack. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Roast in the preheated oven for 30 to 45 minutes, shaking pan every 
            <br>5 to 7 minutes for even browning. Reduce heat when necessary to prevent 
            <br>burning. Brussels sprouts should be darkest brown, almost black, when done. 
            <br>Adjust seasoning with kosher salt, if necessary. Serve immediately. 
        </li>
    </ol>
