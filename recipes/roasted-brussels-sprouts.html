        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            These roasted Brussels sprouts taste sweet and salty at the same time. 
            They're seasoned perfectly and very easy to make. The sprouts should be 
            brown with deliciously crispy bits on the outside when done 
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ pounds Brussels sprouts, ends trimmed and yellow leaves removed</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all your ingredients. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).</li>
            <li>
                Place trimmed Brussels sprouts, olive oil, kosher salt, and pepper in a large 
                resealable plastic bag. Seal tightly, and shake to coat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour onto a baking sheet, and place on center oven rack. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Roast in the preheated oven for <span>30 to 45 minutes</span>, shaking pan every 
                <span>5 to 7 minutes</span> for even browning. Reduce heat when necessary to prevent 
                burning. Brussels sprouts should be darkest brown, almost black, when done. 
                Adjust seasoning with kosher salt, if necessary. Serve immediately. 
            </li>
        </ol>
