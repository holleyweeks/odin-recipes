        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This is the best sugar cookie recipe and the only one I use. 
            Whenever you make these cookies for someone, be sure to bring along several 
            copies of the recipe — you will be asked for it, I promise! 
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cusps white sugar</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups butter, softened</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
            <li>
                Beat sugar and softened butter together in a large bowl with an electric
                mixer until smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Beat in eggs and vanilla. Stir in flour, baking powder, and salt. 
                Cover, and chill dough <span>overnight</span>. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly dust a work surface
                with flour. Roll out dough to 1/4 to 1/2 inch thickness. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Cut into shapes with any cookie cutter. Place cookies 1 inch apart on
                ungreased baking sheets.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly browned, <span>6 to 8 minutes</span>.
                Carefully transfer cookies to a wire rack and cool completely before decorating.
